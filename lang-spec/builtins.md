# Built-in identifiers — predeclared scope

The contents of the *predeclared* scope (per
`name-resolution.md` §Scopes #5). Everything here is in scope at
the start of every Aril compilation, before any user `import` or
top-level declaration. Names in this scope can be shadowed by
user code but doing so is bad style.

This file is the **single source of truth** for built-in
signatures. Type rules reference these signatures by name — see
`type-system.md` for how each operation is typed.

**Authority.** This file is the contract. Cross-refs to
`keywords.md` (the bare list), `type-system.md` (rules that
consume these signatures), and `ast.md` (node kinds for the
literal forms).

## Notation

```
fn name<TypeParams>(p1: T1, p2: T2, ...): R
```

is the canonical signature shape. `<TypeParams>` is omitted when
the function is not generic. `name(...)` may be written by users
unqualified (it lives in the predeclared scope). Methods on
container types are written as `T.method(...)` here and called as
`receiver.method(...)` at use-sites.

Lower-case `int`, `string`, etc. are primitive types from
`ast.md PrimitiveName`. Upper-case `Option`, `Result`, etc. are
predeclared generic types defined below.

## Primitive types

The closed set of primitive type names — exactly mirrors
`ast.md PrimitiveName`:

```
bool
int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64
byte                                    [= uint8 alias at the type level —
                                         distinct as a token, identical
                                         as a type]
rune                                    [= int32 codepoint]
float32  float64
string                                  [UTF-8 byte sequence, indexable
                                         by byte but iterable by rune;
                                         see for-loop iter rules]
unit                                    [only inhabitant `()`]
```

`byte` aliases `uint8` and `rune` aliases `int32`; the alias is
*reflective* — `byte` and `uint8` are interchangeable at type
positions, but tokens are not rewritten and diagnostics quote
the source spelling.

## Special types

`Never` and `Any` are predeclared **non-primitive** types: they
are not in `ast.md PrimitiveName` but live in the predeclared
scope as `NamedType` (with no type args).

- **`Never`** — bottom type; no inhabitants. Produced by
  `DivergingExpr` (`return`/`break`/`continue`/`panic`/`os.exit`).
  Subtypes every other type per `type-system.md` §Notation
  (`Never <: T` for all `T`).
- **`Any`** — escape type used at binding-boundary
  `...Any` variadic parameters. Does **not** narrow back to a
  concrete `T`; users may not introduce `Any`-typed parameters
  in their own code (D11, enforced by the resolver).
- **`Dynamic`** — user-facing runtime-erased wrapper for values
  whose static type is unknown to the caller, used by the
  `reflect` module. Introduced only at `reflect.*` parameter
  sites of formal type `Dynamic` (implicit widen) or via
  explicit `reflect.box`. Eliminated only via `reflect.unbox<T>`
  which returns `Result<T>`. See `type-system.md` §Dynamic for
  the full intro / elim rules. `Any` and `Dynamic` are
  deliberately separate: `Any` is internal FFI; `Dynamic` is
  the explicit user-facing handle the reflection API accepts.

### `error`

```
interface error {
  error(): string
}
```

A nominal interface with a single method `error(): string`. Any
class declaring `implements error` and an `error(): string`
method satisfies it. Bound Go-side `error` values land in Aril as
this interface.

### `Scope`

```
class Scope {
  context: context.Context        [read-only; var-style accessor at the lowering level]
}
```

The receiver of a `scope { ... }` block (see `name-resolution.md`
§Special names). Its only public member is `.context`, the
cancellable context propagated to children. `Scope` is **not**
constructible by users — it's produced by `T-ScopeExpr` and
bound to the lexical identifier `scope`.

## Option

```
type Option<T> =
  | None
  | Some(value: T)
```

Sum type with two variants. The exhaustive forms in the corpus
are `match` on `Some(x) | None`; the predeclared scope also
attaches the following total query/defaulting methods (the
common non-`match` consumptions):

```
Option<T>:
  isSome(): bool                     [Tag == Some]
  isNone(): bool                     [Tag == None]
  unwrapOr(fallback: T): T           [the Some payload, else fallback]
```

`unwrapOr` is the total defaulting form — no `.unwrap` (partial,
panicking) and no `.map` in v1; richer consumption stays
`match`/`try` (see `T-Try-Option`). The methods lower to the
exported arilrt method set (`lowering-go.md` §Container types).

The constructors `Some` and `None` are predeclared variants;
they are usable unqualified.

## Result

```
type Result<T, E> =
  | Ok(value: T)
  | Err(err: E)
```

Sum type. Consumed by pattern match or `try` (see
`T-Try-Result`), or the following total query/defaulting
methods:

```
Result<T, E>:
  isOk(): bool                       [Tag == Ok]
  isErr(): bool                      [Tag == Err]
  unwrapOr(fallback: T): T           [the Ok payload, else fallback]
  mapErr(f: (E) => E2): Result<T, E2>   [transform the Err payload; Ok untouched]
```

`unwrapOr` defaults to the **Ok** payload type `T` (the fallback
is a `T`, not an `E`). E is conventionally bound to `error` but any
type is admissible — `try` requires the inner `E` to equal the
enclosing function's declared error type (no implicit
conversion).

`mapErr` is the **error-conversion** combinator (T-Result-MapErr):
it rewrites the `Err` payload `E → E2` through the handler and
leaves an `Ok` untouched, so the value keeps flowing as a
`Result<T, E2>`. It is the bridge that lets a plain `try` cross an
error-type boundary — `try f().mapErr((e) => Wrapped{…})` propagates
where the enclosing function's error type differs from `f`'s, with
no hand-written `match`. Still deliberately out of v1: the Ok-mapping
`.map` and the partial, panicking `.unwrap` (richer Ok consumption
stays `match` / `try` / `unwrapOr`). `mapErr` lowers to the free
`arilrt.MapErr` helper (a Go method cannot introduce the fresh `E2`
type parameter), the closure to a Go func literal.

**Default error parameter.** When `E` is omitted from a written
type — `Result<T>` rather than `Result<T, E>` — the second
parameter defaults to `error`. The full form `Result<T, error>`
and the shorthand `Result<T>` denote the same type. The default
applies anywhere a `Result` type appears (declarations, return
types, parameter types, generic arguments, including in spec
files such as `type-system.md` §Dynamic and §reflect below).
Writing `Result<T, E>` with an explicit `E` is required when
`E ≠ error`.

`Ok` / `Err` are predeclared variants, unqualified usable.

## Slice methods (`[]T`)

`[]T` is a built-in type (per `ast.md SliceType`); the
predeclared scope attaches the following total methods to every
slice value:

```
[]T:
  len(): int
  push(e: T): []T                    [returns a NEW slice; the original is
                                       unchanged at the header level. Idiomatic
                                       use: `xs = xs.push(e)`]
  copy(): []T                        [shallow header-copy with fresh backing
                                       array; used when callers must isolate
                                       mutations]
```

`push` does not mutate the receiver's header — it produces a new
slice with the element appended. The backing array may be
shared with the original if capacity allowed; callers that need
isolation should `copy()` first. This matches the corpus
convention (`xs = xs.push(v)` everywhere).

Slices also support:
- index read `s[i]: T` (T-Index-Slice, `type-system.md`),
- index write `s[i] = v` (slice index-write mutates the backing
  array, not the header — see `type-system.md` §Bindings and
  assignment),
- slicing `s[low:high]: []T` (T-Slice),
- iteration: `for x in s { ... }` (`T`), or
  `for (i, x) in s { ... }` (`(int, T)`) — see `IterElem` below.

## Map

```
class Map<K, V> {
  static new(): Map<K, V>
  static from(pairs: [](K, V)): Map<K, V>

  len(): int
  has(k: K): bool
  get(k: K): Option<V>             [total — returns None on miss]
  set(k: K, v: V): unit
  delete(k: K): unit
  keys(): []K
  values(): []V
  entries(): [](K, V)              [deferred — not implemented in v1; iterate with `for (k, v) in m`]
}
```

`Map<K, V>` keys must be comparable. The brace literal form is
`Map<K, V>{ k1: v1, ..., kn: vn }` (`T-Map-Lit`). The
`m[k]` index form (`T-Index-Map`) returns `V` directly and
yields V's Go-side zero value on miss — `0` for numeric V, `""`
for string, the first declared variant for sum-typed V, and so
on. This mirrors Go's map-index semantics and makes the common
counter / flag pattern (`m[k] = m[k] + 1`) Just Work. When the
caller needs to distinguish "missing" from "zero-valued"
explicitly the **total**-API path is `m.get(k): Option<V>`
followed by a `match`.

`m[k] = v` (index-assign) lowers to `m.set(k, v)` — the wrapper
keeps insertion order in sync with the backing map so a later
`m.keys()` (or `for (k, v) in m`) iterates in the order keys were
first written.

Iteration: `for (k, v) in m { ... }` (`IterElem(Map<K, V>) =
(K, V)`). Order is **insertion order**: the order in which
`m.set(k, ...)` was first called for each `k`. This is stronger
than Go's randomised iteration order — Aril preserves order for
predictable golden tests (see the Lowering pointers section
below for the implementation strategy).

## Set

```
class Set<T> {
  static new(): Set<T>
  static from(elems: []T): Set<T>

  len(): int
  has(e: T): bool
  add(e: T): unit                  [idempotent — re-adding an existing
                                     element is a no-op]
  delete(e: T): unit
  toSlice(): []T
}
```

`Set<T>` element type must be comparable. The brace literal form
is `Set<T>{ e1, ..., en }` (`T-Set-Lit`).

Iteration: `for e in s { ... }` — insertion order (same
ordering invariant as `Map`).

## Stack

```
class Stack<T> {
  static new(): Stack<T>

  len(): int
  push(e: T): unit
  pop(): Result<T, error>          [total — Err("empty stack") on empty,
                                     so `try stack.pop()` propagates inside
                                     a Result-returning function]
  peek(): Option<T>                [total — None on empty; does not consume]
}
```

LIFO. Brace literal `Stack<T>{ e1, e2, ..., en }` (`T-Stack-Lit`)
pushes in left-to-right order, so `e_n` is on top after construction.

`pop()` returns `Result<T, error>` because corpus usage (e.g.
`examples/modeling-errors/rpn_calculator/rpn_calculator.aril`,
`examples/core-language/valid_parentheses/valid_parentheses.aril`) consumes it with
`try` inside `Result`-returning functions and with `match Ok/Err`
arms. The asymmetric `peek(): Option<T>` choice reflects intent:
`peek` is "look without committing", `pop` is "consume; propagate
emptiness as an error".

Stack values are **not iterable** in v1 — there is no
`for x in stack` form (no corpus site uses it). If a consumer
needs ordered iteration, drain by popping in a loop until
`len() == 0`.

## Channel

```
class Channel<T> {
  send(v: T): unit
  recv(): T
  tryRecv(): Option<T>             [None when buffer empty
                                     (non-blocking, distinct from EOF)]
  close(): unit
}

class SendChan<T> {                [send-only widening of Channel<T>]
  send(v: T): unit
  close(): unit                    [producer closes the channel to signal EOF
                                     to consumers; idiomatic pipeline-stage
                                     pattern across the corpus]
}

class RecvChan<T> {                [recv-only widening of Channel<T>]
  recv(): T
  tryRecv(): Option<T>
}
```

Created via `makeChannel<T>()` or `makeChannel<T>(cap: int)`
(below). Widening from `Channel<T>` to `SendChan<T>` /
`RecvChan<T>` is implicit at call sites — see `T-Chan-Widen`.
The reverse is not allowed.

`recv()` blocks; `tryRecv()` does not. `recv()` on a closed
channel returns the zero value for `T` (Go semantics) — but
Aril's recommended idiom is `for v in ch { ... }` which exits on
close. `close()` is exposed on `Channel<T>` and `SendChan<T>`
but NOT on `RecvChan<T>` — only the owner / producer side may
close. Closing a closed channel panics at runtime.

Iteration: `for v in ch { ... }` over a `RecvChan<T>` —
terminates cleanly when the channel closes (`IterElem(RecvChan<T>)
= T`).

## `reflect` module

Runtime-supplied module. Unlike `fmt`, `strings`, `os` (which
are Go-stdlib bindings per D6), `reflect` is implemented in
`arilrt/reflect` and ships with the Aril runtime — not a binding
to any Go package. The surface is governed by **D18**
(`docs/design-decisions.md`): contract invariants CT1–CT3
(private/public layer split, version-locking, append-only ABI)
and performance invariants P1–P3 (passive metadata, explicit
`Dynamic`, no universal `Value` lowering).

Imported as `import reflect`. Per the layer split (D18), only
programs that import `reflect` ship the descriptor registry and
boxing helpers in their binary; reflection-free programs are
unaffected.

Unlike the container builtins above (`Map`, `Set`, `Stack`,
`Channel`), `reflect` is a module of free functions rather than
a class — the surface is documented as **Types**, **Functions**,
and **Constraints** subsections below rather than as a single
`class` block.

### Types

```
type Type             // opaque descriptor; equal iff describes the same Aril type

type Kind =
  | Primitive
  | Class
  | Sum
  | Slice
  | Function
  | Unit

type FieldInfo = {
  name: string,
  desc: Type,           // field name `desc`, not `type` — `type` is a Aril keyword
}

type MethodInfo = {
  name: string,
  is_static: bool,
}

type VariantInfo = {
  name: string,
  tag:  int,
}
```

`Type` is opaque — its internal representation is part of
`arilrt/reflect` (private under CT1) and not observable to
user code beyond the functions below. Two `Type` values are
**equal** iff they describe the same Aril type; this is the
only externally observable invariant on `Type` identity.

### Functions

Total queries — always succeed:

```
typeOf(v: Dynamic): Type
typeName(t: Type): string         // Aril-side spelling, e.g. "Counter", "int", "Option<int>"
kind(t: Type): Kind
```

Total queries returning the empty slice for kinds where the
question is vacuous (e.g., fields on a primitive). Use
`kind(t)` to distinguish "no fields because not a record"
from "record with zero fields":

```
fields(t: Type): []FieldInfo
methods(t: Type): []MethodInfo
variants(t: Type): []VariantInfo
typeArgs(t: Type): []Type
```

Partial queries returning `Result<T>` — **panic-free**. The
`Err` payload carries a runtime `error` value with a
human-readable message (no compile-time diagnostic code —
those are reserved for sema). Each function describes its
`Err` cases in the comment beside its signature:

```
fieldValue(v: Dynamic, name: string): Result<Dynamic>   // Err: no such field, or v is not a class/record
variantOf(v: Dynamic): Result<VariantInfo>              // Err: v is not a sum value
elementType(t: Type): Result<Type>                      // Err: t has no single element type
```

`elementType` is defined for `Slice` `Kind` only — it returns
the slice's element type wrapped in `Ok`. For every other
`Kind` (`Primitive`, `Class`, `Sum`, `Function`, `Unit`) the
call returns `Err`. Map / set values, function-return types,
and sum-variant payloads are reached via `fields`, `methods`,
and `variants` rather than through `elementType`.

Boxing / unboxing:

```
box<T>(v: T): Dynamic              // explicit widen-to-Dynamic
unbox<T>(d: Dynamic): Result<T>    // type-checked unwrap; Err on descriptor mismatch
```

The type parameter `<T>` of `box` is inferred from the
argument. The type parameter of `unbox` is required explicitly
at the call site (return-only generics — see Open Question 1
in RFC-0003).

Rendering — the runtime building block for the REPL
auto-printer and `:inspect`:

```
show(d: Dynamic): string           // total — best-effort pretty-print
```

`show` walks the descriptor recursively: primitives render via
their natural spelling (`int`/`float` decimals, `string` quoted,
`bool` as `true`/`false`), classes as `Name{field: value, ...}`,
and any other kind falls back to a `<TypeName>` placeholder
until later Block-R PRs cover sums / slices / maps. `show`
never panics and never returns `Err` — when reflection cannot
read a field, the field renders as `field: <unreadable>` and
walking continues; a class graph with a back-edge renders the
revisit as `<cycle ClassName>` rather than blowing the stack.

### Constraints

- The reflection API is **panic-free**: every partial operation
  returns `Result`. This is a hard contract — adding a panicking
  `reflect.*` function violates the API discipline.
- Mutation via reflection (`setField`, `callMethod`, ...) is
  **not** in v1 — it adds semantics obligations (does the
  receiver narrow? can you set a `let` field?) that need their
  own RFC.
- The `Dynamic` introduction rule (`T-Dyn-Intro-Reflect` in
  `type-system.md`) fires only for functions in **this** module;
  a user-defined function taking `Dynamic` requires explicit
  `reflect.box` at the call site.

## Variant constructors (predeclared)

```
None : Option<T>                   [no payload]
Some<T>(value: T) : Option<T>

Ok<T, E>(value: T) : Result<T, E>
Err<T, E>(err: E)  : Result<T, E>
```

The type parameters `T` and `E` are inferred from the call site.
The expressions `Some(3)` and `Err("boom")` carry only the
constructor name in the AST (`VariantExpr`); the resolver maps
them to the sum types `Option<_>` and `Result<_, _>` via
predeclared lookup.

When a same-named variant exists in a user-defined sum type, the
unqualified form is disambiguated by `E0104` per
`name-resolution.md` §Variant constructors.

## Free functions

fn refEq<C>(a: C, b: C): bool          [C must be a class type or an
                                         opaque foreign handle (extern

                                        the method `this.error()`, not to this

                                        wrapper to disambiguate if needed.]
```

`panic` aborts with `msg` on stderr and exit code 2 (matching Go
runtime panic). `refEq` is the only way to compare class
instances for identity — the `==` operator is illegal on class
values (E0401, comparable rule excludes classes — see
`type-system.md` §Arithmetic and logical operators).

## Conversion functions

Each primitive type name acts as a conversion function. The
legal source/target pairs are exactly `ConvOK` from
`type-system.md` §Conversions; this table mirrors them:

```
fn int(x: T): int                  [T ∈ numeric, byte, rune]
fn int8(x: T): int8                [same]
fn int16(x: T): int16
fn int32(x: T): int32
fn int64(x: T): int64
fn uint(x: T): uint
fn uint8(x: T): uint8
fn uint16(x: T): uint16
fn uint32(x: T): uint32
fn uint64(x: T): uint64
fn byte(x: T): byte                [T ∈ numeric, byte, rune]
fn rune(x: T): rune                [T ∈ integer primitives, byte]
fn float32(x: T): float32          [T ∈ numeric]
fn float64(x: T): float64          [T ∈ numeric]
fn string(x: T): string            [T ∈ []byte, rune (UTF-8 single-codepoint),
                                     integer (codepoint encoding)]
```

`string(x)` with `x : int` encodes the codepoint as UTF-8 (Go
semantics). `string(s : []byte)` matches Go's `string([]byte)`:
the runtime makes a defensive copy; the result is immutable and
independent of subsequent mutations to `s`.

Out-of-set conversions fire **E0205 Illegal type conversion**.

## Iterable<T>

`Iterable<T>` is the (closed) set of source-types that can be
the right-hand side of `for x in <iter>`. D11 parks the
extensibility — user types cannot opt in in v1.

Notable absence: `Stack<T>` is not iterable in v1 (see §Stack).

See `type-system.md` §Control-flow expressions, T-For.

## Comparable / Ord

Two closed sets used by `T-Cmp` (`==` / `!=`) and `T-Ord`
(`<` / `<=` / `>` / `>=`) respectively.

```
Comparable (T-Cmp, for == / !=):
  | numeric primitives (int, int8..int64, uint..uint64, byte, rune,
                        float32, float64)
  | string
  | bool
  | rune                                          [as integer codepoint]
  | tuple T1 × T2 × ... iff each Ti Comparable
  | record { f1: T1; ... } iff each Ti Comparable

Ord (T-Ord, for < / <= / > / >=):
  | numeric primitives
  | string                                        [lexicographic byte-wise]
  | rune                                          [codepoint order]
  | bool                                          [false < true, mirroring Go]
```

Notably excluded from **both**: function values, channels, maps,
sets, stacks, slices, class instances. Use `refEq` for class
identity; manual field-wise comparison otherwise. `Ord` excludes
tuples and records — there is no v1 lexicographic comparison
for composite types (corpus does not need one; D11 parks bounded
generics that would enable it).

## Lowering pointers

Each built-in maps onto a Go construct at codegen time. The full
table is forthcoming in `lowering-go.md` (Formalization-I);
sketch below for reviewers' orientation:

| Aril built-in | Go lowering |
|---|---|
| `int`, `float64`, ... | identical Go primitives |
| `string` | Go `string`; `s.len()` lowers to `len(s)` (byte length), `s.bytes()` to `[]byte(s)`, `s.runes()` to `[]rune(s)` (codepoint view) |
| `[]T` | `[]T`; `xs.push(e)` lowers to `append(xs, e)`; `xs.len()` to `len(xs)`; `xs.copy()` to a fresh-backing clone (see `lowering-go.md` §Slice methods) |
| `Option<T>` | tagged struct `{tag uint8; v T}` (zero-cost for `None`) |
| `Result<T, E>` | tagged struct `{tag uint8; v T; e E}` |
| `Map<K, V>` | wrapper around `map[K]V` plus `[]K` for insertion-order |
| `Set<T>` | wrapper around `map[T]struct{}` plus `[]T` for order |
| `Stack<T>` | wrapper around `[]T` with `len`-based push/pop; `pop()` checks length and returns `Err` on empty |
| `Channel<T>` | `chan T` |
| `SendChan<T>` | `chan<- T` |
| `RecvChan<T>` | `<-chan T` |
| `error` | Go `error` interface |
| `Dynamic` | `arilrt.Dynamic` struct (payload + descriptor pointer); never `interface{}` alone — see D18-P3 |
| `reflect.*` functions | calls into `arilrt/reflect`; descriptors built at codegen time and registered in the runtime registry *(impl: Block R)* |
| `scope { ... }` | `errgroup.Group` + cancellable `context.Context` |
| `spawn` | `g.Go(func() error { ... })` |
| `makeChannel<T>(n)` | `make(chan T, n)` |
| `makeSlice<T>(n)` | `make([]T, n)` |
| `panic(msg)` | `panic(msg)` |
| `refEq(a, b)` | `a == b` (interface / pointer identity) |

## Built-in errors — quick index

The full catalog lives in `diagnostics.md` (forthcoming). Codes
touched by this file:

- **E0205** — Illegal type conversion (source/target pair not in
  the conversion table).
- **E0206** — `refEq` on operands that are not the same class or
  opaque foreign handle.
- **E0103** — Unknown name (any predeclared identifier that
  isn't in this catalog and isn't user-defined).
- **E0104** — Ambiguous variant name (built-in vs user-defined
  same-name variant — see name-resolution).
- **E0209**–**E0212** — `Dynamic` widening / narrowing / generic
  flow / `Any`-`Dynamic` mixing diagnostics, raised by sema per
  `type-system.md` §Dynamic. *(Message text: PR-S5 /
  `diagnostics.md`.)*

The catalog must be exhaustive: any name resolved through the
predeclared scope must appear here, and the v1 corpus must not
reference a built-in name not in this file. The Formal-L corpus
audit gates this invariant.
